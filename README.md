# python-burp
Repository containing sample scripts for use with the Python Scripter Burp Suite extension (https://portswigger.net/bappstore/eb563ada801346e6bdb7a7d7c5c52583).

This repository contains some sample python scripts for modifying values in GET and POST requests. These can be copied directly into the Python Scripter Burp Suite extension window and modified to suit the needs of the application.

It also contains an example PHP application and accompanying Python script, that can be used to test out the extension. A walkthough of using the extension and script can be found at https://labs.jumpsec.com/.
